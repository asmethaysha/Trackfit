# Trackfit
This is a web application which will be personal health tracker for our users. This application is designed to help users monitor their health and wellbeing. They can log their workout data, nutrition intake, weight, sleep, other fitness related metrics and visualize trends of these metrics over time to assess their health overall.

We created the GUI for the Application where user can log
